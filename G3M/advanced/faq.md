## General

### What is G3M?

G3M is a desktop launcher and mod manager for supported GameMaker-based games.
It handles browsing, importing, organizing, patching, launching, and restoring
game files around the current mod set.

### Is G3M free?

Yes. G3M is free and open-source software, licensed under GPL-3.0.

### What platforms does G3M support?

Windows 10 (version 1809+), macOS, and Linux. The primary development platform
is Windows.

### What games does G3M support?

Built-in support currently covers DELTARUNE, DELTARUNEdemo, UNDERTALE, UNDERTALE
Yellow, Pizza Tower, Sugary Spire, and FRICKBEARS3. You can also add custom
single-tab games.

### Do I need to install Python to use G3M?

application.

## Mods

### Where can I find mods?

G3M has a built-in Mods Browser that connects directly to GameBanana. You can
browse, search, and download mods without leaving the application. You can also
import mods from local files obtained from other sources.

### Can I use multiple mods at once?

Yes. G3M supports selecting multiple mods per game chapter. They are applied in
order — see [Modpacks](../mods/modpacks.md).

### Will mods break my game?

No. G3M automatically backs up all original game files before applying mods and
restores them after you exit the game. Your game files are never permanently
modified. See [Backup & Restore](backup-and-restore.md).

### What mod formats does G3M support?

- **g3mpatch** — G3M's native patch format (compact, fast).
- **xdelta / vcdiff** — Standard binary diff patches.
- **CSX scripts** — C# scripts for programmatic modifications.
- **Raw data files** — Complete data file replacements.
- **DELTAMOD** — Auto-converted on import.
- **PizzaOven** — Auto-converted for Pizza Tower mods.

See [Patching Formats](../mods/patching-formats.md) for details.

### Can I create my own mods?

Yes. G3M includes a Mod Editor for creating mods from scratch and a full set of
Modding Tools for creating patches, converting formats, merging data, and more.
See [Creating Mods](../mods/creating-mods.md).

### How do I update a mod?

If the mod was downloaded from GameBanana, G3M detects when a newer version is
available and shows an "Update" indicator. Click the action button to update.

### Can I share mods with friends?

Yes. Use the **Export** button on a mod card to create a `.zip` file. Send the
file to your friend, who can import it into their G3M using Library → Add Mod →
Import Mod.

## Installation & Setup

### How do I set up my game?

Go to Settings → Game → click the change path button for your game → select the
game's installation folder. G3M validates the path by looking for the game's
executable. See [Getting Started](../getting-started.md).

### Can G3M detect my game automatically?

Yes. On first launch, G3M scans common Steam installation paths and known
directories to auto-detect installed games. See
[Game Detection](../games/game-detection.md).

### What if my game is not detected?

Set the path manually in Settings → Game. Navigate to the folder containing the
game's executable.

### Can I use G3M with a non-Steam version of the game?

Yes. G3M works with any installation of the game, whether from Steam, itch.io,
or a direct download. Just point the game path to the correct folder.

## Features

### What are Profiles?

Profiles let you maintain separate installed mod sets and separate per-game
selection state. See [Profiles](../features/profiles.md).

### What is Direct Launch?

For DELTARUNE, Direct Launch lets you skip the title screen and load directly
into a specific chapter. Double-click a chapter tab in the Library to enable it.
See [Launch Modes](../games/launch-modes.md).

### What is Full Install?

Full Install is available for `deltarunedemo`, `undertaleyellow`, `sugaryspire`,
and `frickbears3`. Enable the checkbox for the selected supported game, then run
the install flow. See [Full Install](../games/full-install.md).

### Can I create desktop shortcuts?

Yes. G3M can create desktop shortcuts that patch mods and launch a game without
opening the full UI. See [Desktop Shortcuts](../features/shortcuts.md).

### What happens if the game is already running?

G3M still opens normally. The main **Launch** button stays disabled while a
supported game process is already running, and the status bar names the process
that must be closed before launching from G3M.

### What are Plugins?

Plugins are third-party extensions that add functionality to G3M. They can hook
into the mod lifecycle, add settings UI, and more. See
[Plugins](../features/plugins.md).

## Customization

### Can I change G3M's appearance?

Yes, extensively. G3M supports:

- Seven customizable theme colors.
- Custom background images or videos.
- Custom fonts.
- Custom logo.
- Custom startup sound and background music.
- Adjustable border radius.
- Theme import/export.

See [Customization](../customization/README.md).

### How do I share my theme?

Export your theme as a `.zip` file (Settings → Appearance → Export Theme). Send
the file to someone else, who can import it in their G3M. See
[Theme Packages](../customization/theme-packages.md).

---

## Privacy & Security

### Does G3M collect personal data?

No. G3M has a two-tier anonymous analytics system. A small set of always-on
events (app launch, mod installs, game launches) is always collected with no
personal information. An additional opt-in tier collects more detail and is
**disabled by default**. See [Analytics](analytics.md).

### Are one-click install links safe?

G3M always shows a confirmation dialog before downloading from a one-click
install link. You must explicitly approve the download. See
[One-Click Install](one-click-install.md).

### Can mods contain viruses?

G3M itself does not scan mods for malware. GameBanana has its own file scanning
system. Always download mods from trusted sources. CSX script mods execute code,
so only use scripts from sources you trust.

## Technical

### Where does G3M store its data?

- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\G3M`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/G3M`
- Linux: `~/.local/share/G3M`

### How do I report a bug?

1. Check the log file at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\G3M\logs\g3m.log` on Windows,
   `~/.local/share/G3M/logs/g3m.log` on Linux, or
   `~/Library/Application Support/G3M/logs/g3m.log` on macOS.
2. Report the issue on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/y114git/G3M/issues)
   with a description and the relevant log sections.
3. Or reach out on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/2MFdvFfD9a).

### How do I reset G3M to defaults?

Delete the entire user data folder (see locations above) and restart G3M.
Warning: this removes all mods, profiles, and settings.

### Can I run multiple versions of G3M?

G3M enforces a single running instance. You cannot run two copies
simultaneously. However, you can install different versions in different folders
and use them at different times.

### What is the "Librarby" easter egg?

Very rarely, the Library tab label shows "Librarby" instead of "Library". It's a
harmless easter egg.
