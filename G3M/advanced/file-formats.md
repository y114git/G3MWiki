# File Formats Reference

This page catalogs every file format that G3M reads, writes, or processes.

---

## Game Data Files

These are the main data files for GameMaker-based games. G3M patches these files when applying mods.

| Extension | Platform | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.win` | Windows | The primary GameMaker data file on Windows (commonly `data.win`). |
| `.ios` | iOS | GameMaker data file for iOS builds (commonly `game.ios`). |
| `.unx` | Linux | GameMaker data file for Linux/Unix builds. |
| `.droid` | Android | GameMaker data file for Android builds. |

---

## Patch Formats

Patches modify game data files without replacing them entirely. G3M supports multiple patch formats.

### g3mpatch

- **Extension**: `.g3mpatch` or `.zip` containing `g3mpatch.json`
- **Created by**: G3MTool (bundled with G3M)
- **Description**: G3M's native patch format. Contains a JSON manifest (`g3mpatch.json`) describing which chunks of the data file to modify, along with the modified chunk data. Can be stored as a single `.g3mpatch` file or as a `.zip` archive containing the manifest and data files.
- **Advantages**: Compact (only changed data is stored), supports verification, created automatically by Modding Tools.

### xdelta / vcdiff

- **Extensions**: `.xdelta`, `.vcdiff`
- **Description**: Standard binary diff/patch formats. Stores the minimal set of instructions to transform the original file into the modified version. Requires the original unmodified data file to apply.
- **Usage**: Common in the modding community. G3M can both create and apply xdelta patches via G3MTool.

### CSX Scripts

- **Extension**: `.csx`
- **Description**: C# script files executed by G3MTool against a game data file. Allows programmatic modifications (adding sprites, changing code, modifying resources). More flexible than binary patches but requires G3MTool to execute.
- **Usage**: Advanced mod creation. Scripts can perform complex transformations that binary patches cannot express.

## Mod Configuration

### mod_config.json

The core metadata file for every G3M mod. JSON format.

**Top-level fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `config_version` | string | Schema version (e.g., `"1.0.0"`). |
| `metadata` | object | Nested object containing all mod metadata (see below). |
| `info_files` | object | Optional ordered map of root documentation files to `"show"` / `"hide"` for the Info dialog. |
| `files` | object | Chapter-to-file mapping (see below). |

**`metadata` object fields:**

| Field | Type | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | `"local_abc123"` or `"gb_mod_45678"` |
| `name` | string | `"My Awesome Mod"` |
| `version` | string | `"1.2.0"` |
| `author` | string | `"ModAuthor"` |
| `description` | string | `"A cool mod that changes the intro."` |
| `homepage` | string | `"https://gamebanana.com/mods/12345"` |
| `icon` | string | `"icon.png"` |
| `game` | string | `"deltarune"` |
| `game_version` | string | `"1.10"` |
| `tags` | array | `["customization", "gameplay"]` |

Per-mod playtime, added date, and last-updated timestamps are stored in the profile's `mods_data.json`, not in `mod_config.json`.

**files object:**

Each key is a chapter/section identifier (e.g., `"deltarune_1"`, `"undertale"`, `"pizzatower"`). The value is:

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `description` | string | Chapter-specific description. |
| `data_file_path` | string | Path to the main data/patch file (relative to mod folder). |
| `extra_files` | array | List of additional file paths to copy into the game folder. |

---

## Mod Documentation Files

Documentation files are optional files placed in a mod's root folder. They are not patched into the game. G3M keeps them with the mod, includes them when exporting, and shows them through the mod Info/README viewer when available.

| Extension | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `.md`, `.markdown` | Markdown readme, install notes, credits, changelog, or other mod documentation. |
| `.txt` | Plain-text readme, credits, install notes, or other root documentation. In PizzaOven archives, `.txt` files inside `lang/` are language files instead. |
| `.html`, `.htm` | HTML documentation rendered by the Info/README viewer. |
| `.pdf` | PDF documentation displayed by the Info/README viewer. |

These files are discovered only at the mod root. Files inside game data folders, language folders, or other content directories are treated according to their install path instead.

If `mod_config.json` includes an `info_files` object, G3M uses that map first to control documentation tab order and visibility:

- Keys are root-level relative file names such as `README.md` or `credits.pdf`.
- Values are `"show"` or `"hide"`.
- Entries listed in `info_files` appear first, in the same order they are written in the JSON file.
- Root documentation files not listed in `info_files` still remain visible and are appended afterward in alphabetical order.
- Invalid visibility values are treated as `"show"`.
